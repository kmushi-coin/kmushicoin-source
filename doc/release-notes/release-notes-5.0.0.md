KTV version *v5.0.0* is now available from:  <https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/issues>


Mandatory Update
==============

KTV v5.0.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains a protocol upgrade (to `70920`), new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will need to update their clients before enforcement of this update goes into effect.

Update enforcement is currently scheduled to go into effect at the following block height:
```
Mainnet: 2,700,500
```
Masternodes will need to be restarted once both the masternode daemon and the controller wallet have been upgraded.

Note: In preparation for the enforcement, upgraded peers will start rejecting non-upgraded peers few hours before the enforcement block height, we recommend everyone to be updated at max a day before the final time.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/KTV-Qt (on Mac) or ktvd/ktv-qt (on Linux).

#### Sapling Parameters
In order to run, KTV now requires two files, `sapling-output.params` and `sapling-spend.params` (with total size ~50 MB), to be saved in a specific location.

For the following packages, no action is required by the user:
- macOS release `dmg` binaries will use the params that are bundled into the .app bundle.
- Windows installer `.exe` will automatically copy the files in the proper location.
- Linux `PPA/Snap/Copr` installs will automatically copy the files in the proper location.

For the other packages, the user must save the param files in the proper location, before being able to run KTV v5.0.0:
- macOS/Linux `tar.gz` tarballs include a bash script (`install-params.sh`) to copy the parameters in the appropriate location.
- Windows `.zip` users need to manually copy the files from the `share/ktv` folder to the `%APPDATA%\KTVParams` directory.
- self compilers can run the script from the repository sources (`params/install-params.sh`), or copy the files directly from the `params` subdirectory.



Compatibility
==============

KTV is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). KTV software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

KTV should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.


Notable Changes
==============

New SHIELD Protocol Implemented!
--------------------------------

#### Overview
Users will be able to protect their financial information by sending and receiving KTVs privately, as well as sending and receiving encrypted messages attached to the shield transactions.
More visual information about the protocol can be found at https://kmushicoin.co .

#### GUI features
New set of functionalities for the interaction with the SHIELD protocol:

* Receive screen modified to show, generate and set label of wallet's shield addresses.
* Dashboard transactions list including shield transactions.
* Top bar showing shield KTV balances.
* Send screen modified, implementing shield transaction crafting and broadcast.
* New encrypted memo functionality.
* Transaction detail dialog presenting shield transaction information.
* Spending process moved to a background thread, loading screen connected while the operation is being performed.
* Contacts screen modified to store external shield addresses.

#### Wallet
A brand new manager encapsulating all Sapling related capabilities inside the wallet has been implemented:

* New address type: shield addresses (using bech32 format).
* New derivation path for Sapling keys: Shield addresses are derived from the same wallet master seed used for the deterministic derivation of all other keys. The same seed, therefore, can be used to restore both transparent and Shield addresses, recovering both transparent and Shield KTV balance.
* Support for Sapling extended full viewing keys, incoming viewing keys, outgoing viewing keys and spending keys.
* Sapling notes management:
    - Notes decryption.
    - Blockchain scanning protocol: handling when and how to store a Sapling output and its related keys. As well as mark used notes.
    - Notes metadata cache: retrieving information without requiring to decrypt notes on-demand.
    - Able to filter available notes for spending.
* Sapling witnesses and nullifiers tracking.
* New transaction building process, crafting and signing shield transactions.

#### Block Primitive:
* Block version bumped to 8.
* Starting from block v8, the block header includes an additional `uint256` field, `hashFinalSaplingRoot` (which adds 32 bytes to the end of the serialized block header) storing the root of the Sapling note commitment tree, corresponding to the final Sapling treestate of this block.
* Each block index now is tracking the network total value entering and exiting the shield pool.

#### Transaction Primitive:
* The "transaction type" concept was introduced, dividing the version field (4 bytes) in version (first 2 bytes) and type (second 2 bytes).
* For transactions with `nVersion >= 3`, a new optional field `sapData` has been included, comprising:
    - `valueBalance`: the net value of Sapling spend transfers minus output transfers
    - `vShieldedSpend`: a sequence of Sapling spend descriptions
    - `vShieldedOutput`: a sequence of Sapling output descriptions
    - `bindingSig`: the Sapling binding signature
* Transactions with `nVersion >= 3` and `nType != 0`(not enabled by consensus at the moment), are defined "special transactions" and must include an extra payload serialized according to the definition imposed by the relative type.
* A new signature hash for Sapling and Special transactions has been implemented (as defined in [ZIP-243](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0243)).

#### Additional Consensus Rules
- Transactions with version >= 3 must have the new serialization (including a zero byte for empty `Optional`, if missing `sapData` or `extraPayload`).
- Shield transactions cannot be coinbase or coinstake transactions.
- Transactions containing empty `vin` must have non-empty `vShieldedSpend`.
- Transactions containing empty `vout` must have non-empty `vShieldedOutput`.
- Transactions with version >= 4 are not accepted
- The maximum size of a single Shield transaction is 400 kB.
- The sum of the sizes of all Shield transactions in a block cannot be greater than 750 kB.

#### Fee Policy
The `minRelayTxFee` startup argument is multiplied by a fixed factor `K = 100` for Shield transactions. This makes the fee required to relay Shield transactions (and "dust" threshold value) 100 times higher than a transparent transaction of the same size.

#### Build System
In order to support the protocol, the following dependencies are introduced in the build system:
- `Sodium` https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium
- `Rust/Cargo`https://www.rust-lang.org/

HD Wallet upgrade
-----------------
In order to support the Shield features, the wallet must be upgraded to `SAPLING_VERSION`.

*How do I check my wallet version?*
* Check the output of `getinfo` or `getwalletinfo`.<br>The `"walletversion"` field must be equal to `170000` (`SAPLING_VERSION`)

*How do I upgrade my HD wallet to `SAPLING_VERSION`?*
* Newly created wallets have already the latest version
* If the wallet is unlocked, use the `-upgradewallet` init flag to automatically update at startup.<br>Otherwise use the GUI or RPC (see below) to unlock and upgrade the wallet.
* GUI:
    - A dialog will appear on every wallet startup notifying you that you are running a pre-Sapling wallet and letting you upgrade it from there.
    - If you haven't upgraded your wallet, the topbar (bar with icons that appears at the top of your wallet) will have an "HD" icon. Click it and the upgrade dialog will be launched.
* RPC:
    - use the `upgradewallet` after unlocking the wallet (if locked)

Tier Two Network
----------------
A large number of performance and stability improvements over the complete tier two network and masternodes sources have been performed. Re-writing, encapsulating and decoupling workflows, cleaning up an extensive number of redundancies and misalignment.
Plus, tier two and masternodes capabilities have been introduced to regtest, enabling the local testing environment setup and the creation of a functional testing framework for the area.
This work is directly correlated with a substantial efficiency improvement for the entire software, not only for masternodes, and is one of the building blocks for the new tier two network and sync protocol that will be continued post-v5.

Instant Proposal Removal:
The threshold was increased to 30% of negative votes.
The proposal will never be removed before its first superblock.

Maximum Proposal Payment:
The limit was decreased to a maximum of 6 payments.

Concurrency
-----------
A complete overhaul of the thread synchronization area has been done, all of the workflows that were containing locks with cyclic dependencies that could cause a deadlock were reworked.
Solving every circular dependency, a good number of inconsistent states were fixed. The software now can be fully run with the `--enable-debug` configure time flag without crashing for a possible deadlock.

Account API Removed
-------------------

The 'account' API was deprecated in v4.2.0, and has been fully removed in v5.0.0.
The 'label' API was introduced in v4.2.0 as a replacement for accounts.

See the release notes from [v4.2.0](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-4.2.0.md#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet) for a full description of the changes from the 'account' API to the 'label' API.

SwiftX Removed
--------------
Remove obsolete functionality (already disabled via SPORK in the previous releases).
- startup arguments removed:
    * `zmqpubhashtxlock`
    * `zmqpubrawtxlock`
    * `enableswifttx`
    * `swifttxdepth`


- P2P messages deprecated:
    * `MSG_TXLOCK_REQUEST`
    * `MSG_TXLOCK_VOTE`


- GUI changes:
    * remove SwiftX mentions in coin control


- RPC commands removed/modified:
    * `sendtoaddressix` (removed)
    * `sendrawtransaction` (removed `swiftx` optional parameter)
    * decoded transaction `bcconfirmations` JSON entry is now deprecated and kept only for backward compatibility (it is equal to `confirmations`)


- Deprecated Sporks:
    * `SPORK_2_SWIFTTX`
    * `SPORK_3_SWIFTTX_BLOCK_FILTERING`

Zerocoin Protocol Support Removed
---------------------------------
The Core wallet is no longer able to produce (public) zerocoin spends, and those are no longer accepted by consensus.
- Several zerocoin related RPC commands have been removed or changed (as  detailed in the section "RPC Changes" below).
- startup argument removed: `reindexzerocoin`
- GUI: removed transaction records for zerocoin mint outputs


GUI Changes
-----------
#### Shield Protocol
Several views and widgets have been updated to support new features as described in the previous section.

#### RPC Console
- Added autocompletion for the `help` command
- Added warning/confirmation dialog before executing commands that expose private keys (`dumpwallet`, `dumpprivkey`, `exportsaplingkey`)


RPC Changes
------------------
The RPC server now returns a JSON-RPC exception when receiving a request during the warm-up phase. The returned exception includes the current init message ("Loading sporks", "Loading block index", "Verifying blocks", etc...)

#### New RPC Commands

#### Changed RPC Commands

Several RPC commands have had changes to their input arguments or output fields since v4.3.0 to support new functionality. Below is a detailed list of changes to existing RPC commands:

* `dumpwallet`
  A new entry (`warning`) is added to the return object, explaining the risks connected with sharing the output of the command. Also the filename can no longer contain the strings `"bug"` and `"log"`.

* `delegatestake`/`rawdelegatestake`
  A new input parameter (`fUseShielded`) has been added, in order to delegate funds from Shield addresses.

* `getblock`
  A new JSON entry (`finalsaplingroot`) has been added to the return object. (string) The root of the Sapling commitment tree after applying this block.

* `getblockheader`
  A new JSON object (`shield_pool_value`) has been added to the return object with the following information:
  ```
  "shield_pool_value":   (object) Block shield pool value
  {
     "chainValue":        (numeric) Total value held by the Sapling circuit up to and including this block
     "valueDelta":        (numeric) Change in value held by the Sapling circuit over this block
  }
  ```

* `getblockchaininfo`
  A new JSON entry (`initial_block_downloading`) has been added to the return object. (boolean) whether the node is in initial block downloading state or not.
  A new JSON object (`shield_pool_value`) has been added to the return object with the following information:
  ```
  "shield_pool_value":   (object) Chain tip shield pool value
  {
     "chainValue":        (numeric) Total value held by the Sapling circuit up to and including this block
     "valueDelta":        (numeric) Change in value held by the Sapling circuit over this block
  }
  ```

* `getblockindexstats`
  The `fFeeOnly` input argument has been removed.
  The `spendcount` and `pubspendcount` return objects have been removed due to zerocoin deprecation.

* `preparebudget` and `submitbudget`
  A maximum of `6` payment cycles per proposal (`20` on testnet) is now imposed for newly created proposals. Amounts higher than this limit will now return an error message.

* `getbudgetprojection`
  A typo in the JSON return fields has been corrected; `Alloted` and `TotalBudgetAlloted` have been renamed to `Allotted` and `TotalBudgetAllotted` respectively.

* `mnfinalbudget show`
  The `strName` key of the JSON object, representing a finalized budget in the output list, has now the format `"main" (Hash)`. The object no longer has the `"Hash"` entry.

* `sendtoaddress`/`sendmany`
  Shield addresses can be used as recipients. In this case the request is forwarded to `shieldsendmany` with first parameter set to `from_transparent`.

* `startmasternode`
  A new optional input argument (`reload_conf`) has been added to reload the client's `masternode.conf` file in real-time. This optional argument is only available when running `startmasternode` with "alias" being specified as the first argument.

* `decodemasternodebroadcast`
  The `nlastdsq` JSON return entry has been removed. This was a remnant from pre-zerocoin "CoinJoin" mixing.

* `getinfo`
  The `zerocoinbalance` JSON return entry and the `zKTVsupply` return JSON object have been removed due to zerocoin deprecation.
  The `balance` JSON return entry is now all inclusive (the sum of all transparent and shield KTV)
  The `moneysupply` JSON return entry is the total KTV supply (the sum of all transparent and shield KTV)
  A new JSON return entry (`transparentsupply`) has been added to return the sum of the value of all unspent outputs when the chainstate was last flushed to disk.
  A new JSON return entry (`shieldsupply`) has been added to return the shield supply at the chain tip.
  Integrators should switch to the newly added `getsupplyinfo` RPC command for the purpose of obtaining supply information as it is more robust and does not rely on information caching.

* `validateaddress`
  The `account` JSON return entry has been removed due to the removal of the internal accounting system. The `label` entry was it's replacement.

* `getrawtransaction`
  A new JSON return entry (`type`) has been added which indicates via a numeric value the type of transaction (currently not fully implemented).
  A new JSON return array (`shield_addresses`) has been added which will contain a list of shield address strings involved in the transaction (if that information is available to the local client).
  Two new JSON return entries (`extraPayloadSize` and `extraPayload`) have been added pre-emptively to support future implementation of "special" transactions (currently NYI).

* `getrawtransaction` and `decoderawtransaction`
  New JSON output entries have been added to both these commands to detail sapling input/output information after the `vout` array in the following format:
  ```
  "valueBalance": n,          (numeric) The net value of spend transfers minus output transfers
  "valueBalanceSat": n,       (numeric) `valueBalance` in sats
  "vShieldSpend": [               (array of json objects)
     {
       "cv": "hex",         (string) A value commitment to the value of the input note
       "anchor": hex,         (string) A Merkle root of the Sapling note commitment tree at some block height in the past
       "nullifier": hex,       (string) The nullifier of the input note
       "rk": hex,              (string) The randomized public key for spendAuthSig
       "proof": hex,           (string) A zero-knowledge proof using the spend circuit
       "spendAuthSig": hex,    (string) A signature authorizing this spend
     }
     ,...
  ],
  "vShieldOutput": [             (array of json objects)
     {
       "cv": hex,                  (string) A value commitment to the value of the output note
       "cmu": hex,                 (string) The u-coordinate of the note commitment for the output note
       "ephemeralKey": hex,         (string) A Jubjub public key
       "encCiphertext": hex,       (string) A ciphertext component for the encrypted output note
       "outCiphertext": hex,       (string) A ciphertext component for the encrypted output note
       "proof": hex,               (string) A zero-knowledge proof using the output circuit
     }
     ,...
  ],
  "bindingSig": hex,       (string) Prove consistency of valueBalance with the value commitments in spend descriptions and output descriptions, and proves knowledge of the randomness used for the spend and output value commitments
  ```

* `getbalance`
  The `account` input argument has been removed due to the removal of the internal accounting system.
  A new optional input argument (`includeShield`) has been added to include shield balance. Default is `true`.

* `getcoldstakingbalance` and `getdelegatedbalance`
  The optional `account` input argument has been removed due to the removal of the internal accounting system.

* `listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`, `listsinceblock`, and `gettransaction`
  The JSON return entry `account` has been removed due to the removal of the internal accounting system.
  The JSON return entry `bcconfirmations` has been marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.

* `listunspent`
  The JSON return entry `account` has been removed due to the removal of the internal accounting system.
  A new JSON entry (`generated`) has been added to indicate if the txout is a coinstake transaction.
