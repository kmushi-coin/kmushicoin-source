KTV version v5.3.0 is now available from: <https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/releases>

Mandatory Update
==============

KTV v5.3.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will need to update their clients before enforcement of this update goes into effect.

Update enforcement is currently scheduled to go into effect at the following time:

```
Mainnet: block 3,014,000. ~10th September.
```
Masternodes will need to be restarted once both the masternode daemon and the controller wallet have been upgraded.
If you are running a Masternode over Tor, please read the "How To Upgrade" section.

Note: In preparation for the enforcement, upgraded peers will start rejecting non-upgraded peers few hours before the enforcement block height, we recommend everyone to be updated at max a day before the final time.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/KTV-Qt (on Mac) or ktvd/ktv-qt (on Linux).

**Important note for Masternodes running over Tor (v2 onion address):**
Before starting the node, copy the content of the `onion_private_key` file, located inside the data directory into a new `onion_v3_private_key` file inside the same directory.
On linux: `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`.
If the `onion_v3_private_key` file already exist, replace the content with the content of the `onion_private_key` file.

This will allow you to bypass the v2 onion address deprecation and continue running the MN over Tor for now.
Be aware that the Tor network is **completely** removing v2 onion addresses support starting from Oct 15th (see "P2P and network changes" section).
After the v5.3 network upgrade enforcement, the MN will need to be migrated to run on a Tor v3 onion address (Update window Sept 15th - Oct 15th).
If it's not done on time, the node will drop off the network.

Sapling Parameters
==================

In order to run, as all versions after 5.0.0, KTV requires two files, `sapling-output.params` and `sapling-spend.params` (with total size ~50 MB), to be saved in a specific location.

For the following packages, no action is required by the user:
- macOS release `dmg` binaries will use the params that are bundled into the .app bundle.
- Windows installer `.exe` will automatically copy the files in the proper location.
- Linux `PPA/Snap` installs will automatically copy the files in the proper location.

For the other packages, the user must save the param files in the proper location:
- macOS/Linux `tar.gz` tarballs include a bash script (`install-params.sh`) to copy the parameters in the appropriate location.
- Windows `.zip` users need to manually copy the files from the `share/ktv` folder to the `%APPDATA%\KTVParams` directory.
- self compilers can run the script from the repository sources (`params/install-params.sh`), or copy the files directly from the `params` subdirectory.

Compatibility
==============

KTV is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

From KTV v5.3 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported.

KTV should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

The node's known peers are persisted to disk in a file called `peers.dat`. The format of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to accommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if the file is modified by v5.3 or newer then older versions will not be able to read it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error message "Incorrect keysize in addrman deserialization" and will continue normal operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. ([PR #2411](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2411))

Notable Changes
==============

GUI changes
-----------------------

The launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS

#### Subtract Fee From Amount Control

A new checkbox in the send widget allows the user to deduct the fee from the transaction recipient amount.
The most common use-case is when sending the whole balance, or a selection of UTXOs, without getting any change back.
If the transaction has multiple recipients, each recipient can be checked with a toggleable button in the context menu, and the fee will be split, and subtracted evenly from the outputs selected ([PR #2347](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2347)).

#### Settings

A new checkbox added to the wallet settings to enable or disable automatic port mapping with NAT-PMP.
If both UPnP and NAT-PMP are enabled, a successful allocation from UPnP prevails over one from NAT-PMP.<br/>
Note: Successful automatic port mapping requires a router that supports either UPnP or NAT-PMP ([PR #2338](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2338)).

#### RPC-Console

The GUI RPC-Console now accepts "parenthesized syntax", nested commands, and simple queries ([PR #2282](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2282).
A new command `help-console` (available only on the GUI console) documents how to use it:

```
This console accepts RPC commands using the standard syntax.
    example:    getblockhash 0

This console can also accept RPC commands using parenthesized syntax.
    example:    getblockhash(0)

Commands may be nested when specified with the parenthesized syntax.
    example:    getblock(getblockhash(0) true)

A space or a comma can be used to delimit arguments for either syntax.
    example:    getblockhash 0
                getblockhash,0

Named results can be queried with a non-quoted key string in brackets.
    example:    getblock(getblockhash(0) true)[tx]

Results without keys can be queried using an integer in brackets.
    example:    getblock(getblockhash(0),true)[tx][0]
```

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

#### Tor v3 hidden services support - addrv2 message (BIP155)

This release adds support for Tor version 3 hidden services, and rumoring them over the network to other peers using [BIP155](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0155.mediawiki). Version 2 hidden services are still supported by KTV, but the Tor network has started [deprecating](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline) them, and will remove support soon. ([PR #2411](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2411))

The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. KTV will no longer attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.
`cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`.

#### Removal of reject network messages from KTV (BIP61)

Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send valid ("reject") messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a trusted node.
Please use the recommended alternatives if you rely on this feature:

* Testing or debugging of implementations of the KTV P2P network protocol should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent version of KTV. KTV logs debug messages (`-debug=<category>`) to a stream (`-printtoconsole`) or to a file (`-debuglogfile=<debug.log>`).

* Testing the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs (`submitblock`)

* Testing the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs (`sendrawtransaction`)

* Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject" messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation to determine transaction fees. Thus, they could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee target they set (compare the RPC `estimatesmartfee`) or listen for the transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.

Multi-wallet support
--------------------

KTV now supports loading multiple, separate wallets ([PR #2337](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2337)) with individual balances, keys and received transactions.

Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one `-wallet` argument when starting KTV client, either on the command line or in the `ktv.conf` config file.

**In ktv-qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions.** GUI selectable multiple wallets will be supported in a future version. However, even in 5.3, other loaded wallets will remain synchronized to the node's current tip in the background.

KTV 5.3.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and ktv-cli for multi-wallet:

* When running KTV with a single wallet, there are **no** changes to the RPC interface or `ktv-cli`. All RPC calls and `ktv-cli` commands continue to work as before.
* When running KTV with multi-wallet, all *node-level* RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>` endpoint, and `ktv-cli` commands should be run as before. A *node-level* RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.
* When running KTV with multi-wallet, *wallet-level* RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they're intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name>` endpoint, for example `127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat`. `ktv-cli` commands should be run with a `-rpcwallet` option, for example `ktv-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance`.

* A new *node-level* `listwallets` RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the `rpcwallet` argument.

The `getwalletinfo` RPC method returns the name of the wallet used for the query.

Note that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version 5.3.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.

Reindexing changes
------------------

It is now possible to only redo validation, without rebuilding the block index, using the command line option `-reindex-chainstate` (in addition to `-reindex` which does both).
This new option is useful when the blocks on disk are assumed to be fine, but the chainstate is still corrupted. It is also useful for benchmarks ([PR #2391](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2391)).

Mining/Staking transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent")
--------------------------------------------------------------

The block-generation transaction selection algorithm now selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is relayed.
With this change, the `-blockminsize` command line option has been removed.

Removal of Priority Estimation - Coin Age Priority
--------------------------------------------------

In previous versions of KTV, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent. This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners/stakers, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks.
KTV v5.3.0 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority ([PR #2378](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2378)). This has the following implications:

- The concept of *free transactions* has been removed. High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn't attach a miner fee. This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority. The `-limitfreerelay` and `-relaypriority` options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.
- The `-blockprioritysize` option has been removed.
- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC no longer takes a `priority_delta` argument. The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the `fee_delta` argument.
- `-minrelaytxfee` can now be set to 0. If `minrelaytxfee` is set, then fees smaller than `minrelaytxfee` (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation. This defaults to 10000 satoshi/kB.
- The `-printpriority` option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.

Configuration/Settings changes
------------------------------

#### Wallets directory configuration (`-walletdir`)

KTV now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be located. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the KTV data directory ([PR #2423](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2423)). The behavior is now:

- For new installations (where the data directory doesn't already exist), wallets will now be stored in a new `wallets/` subdirectory inside the data directory by default.

- For existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be stored in the data directory root by default. If a `wallets/` subdirectory already exists in the data directory root, then wallets will be stored in the `wallets/` subdirectory by default.

- The location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a `-walletdir=<path>` option where `<path>` can be an absolute path to a directory or directory symlink.

Care should be taken when choosing the wallets directory location, as if it becomes unavailable during operation, funds may be lost.

#### External wallet files

A new `-wallet=<path>` option allows the user to specify the wallet db location. It accepts either absolute paths or paths relative to the `-walletdir` directory. Multiple `-wallet` paths can be configured at the same time in order to run KTV with multiple wallets (see section "Multi-wallet support").

If `-wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a `wallet.dat` data file, a `db.log` file, and `database/log.??????????` files).
If `-wallet=<path>` is specified with paths that are names of existing data files in the `-walletdir` directory, then log files are stored in the parent directory.

#### Configuration sections for testnet and regtest

It is now possible for a single configuration file to set different options for different networks ([PR #2324](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2324)). This is done by using sections or by prefixing the option with the network, such as:
```
    main.uacomment=ktv
    test.uacomment=ktv-testnet
    regtest.uacomment=regtest
    [main]
    mempoolsize=300
    [test]
    mempoolsize=100
    [regtest]
    mempoolsize=20
```
The `addnode=`, `connect=`, `port=`, `bind=`, `rpcport=`, `rpcbind=`, and `wallet=` options will only apply to mainnet when specified in the configuration file, unless a network is specified.

#### Custom directory for blocks storage

A new initialization option flag `-blocksdir` allows the users to store block files outside of the data directory ([PR #2326](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2326)).

#### Enable NAT-PMP port mapping at startup

The `-natpmp` option has been added to use NAT-PMP to map the listening port. If both UPnP and NAT-PMP are enabled, a successful allocation from UPnP prevails over one from NAT-PMP ([PR #2338](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2338)).

#### asmap feature

A new `-asmap` configuration option has been added to diversify the node's network connections by mapping IP addresses Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) and then limiting the number of connections made to any single ASN ([PR #2480](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2480)).

#### Removed startup options

- `printstakemodifier`

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

#### Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments

Commands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the `ktv-cli` binary can now use named arguments. This follows the [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) for passing parameters by-name with an object.
`ktv-cli` has been updated to support this by parsing `name=value` arguments when the `-named` option is given. ([PR #2386](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2386))

Some examples:

```
    src/ktv-cli -named help command="help"
    src/ktv-cli -named getblockhash height=0
    src/ktv-cli -named getblock blockhash=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
    src/ktv-cli -named sendtoaddress address="DMJRSsuU9zfyrvxVaAEFQqK4MxZg6vgeS6" amount="1.0" comment="donation"
```

The order of arguments doesn't matter in this case. Named arguments are also useful to leave out arguments that should stay at their default value.
The RPC server remains fully backwards compatible with positional arguments.

#### Query options for `listunspent` RPC

The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument ([PR #2317](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2317)), which is a JSON object containing one or more of the following members:
  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs
  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs

The `listunspent` RPC also takes an additional boolean argument `include_unsafe` (true by default) to optionally exclude "unsafe" utxos.
An unconfirmed output from outside keys is considered unsafe ([PR #2351](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2351)).

The `listunspent` output also shows whether the utxo is considered safe to spend or not.

#### Wallet name returned by `getwalletinfo`

`walletinfo` return object includes a `"walletname"` field. When KTV is not started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` (and `listwallets`) RPCs is the empty string `""`. If KTV is started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of any wallet is its `<path>` string.

#### Removal of 'detach' argument from `stop`

The `stop` RPC no longer accepts the (already deprecated, ignored, and undocumented) optional boolean argument `detach`.

#### Subtract fee from recipient amount for RPC

- A new argument `subtract_fee_from` is added to `sendmany`/`shieldsendmany` RPC functions.
  It can be used to provide the list of recipent addresses paying the fee.
  ```
  subtract_fee_from         (array, optional)
  A json array with addresses.
  The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address.
    ["address"              (string) Subtract fee from this address
     ,...
    ]
  ```
  Examples:
  ```
  sendmany "" "{\"addr1\":10.04, \"addr2\":0.07, \"addr3\":100}" 1 "test" false "[\"addr1\", \"addr3\"]"

  shieldsendmany "from_shield" "[{\"address\": \"saddr1\", \"amount\":10.04, \"memo\": \"test\"}, {\"address\": \"saddr2\", \"amount\":0.07}, {\"address\": \"saddr3\", \"amount\":100}" 1 0 "[\"saddr1\", \"saddr3\"]"
  ```

- For `fundrawtransaction` a new key (`subtractFeeFromOutputs`) is added to the `options` argument.
  It can be used to specify a list of output indexes.
  ```
  subtractFeeFromOutputs    (array, optional)  A json array of integers.
  The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
  The outputs are specified by their zero-based index, before any change output is added.
    [vout_index,...]
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  fundrawtransaction "rawtxhex" "{\"subtractFeeFromOutputs\":[0,2]}"
  ```

- For `sendtoaddress`, the new parameter is called `subtract_fee` and it is a simple boolean.
  Example:
  ```
  sendtoaddress "addr1" 0.1 "test" "" true
  ```

In all cases the selected recipients will receive less KTV than their corresponding amount set.
If no outputs/addresses are specified, the sender pays the fee as usual. ([PR #2341](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2341))

### New output fields in `getmempoolinfo`

`getmempoolinfo` return object now includes these additional fields:
```
"loaded": true|false      (boolean) Whether the mempool is fully loaded
"maxmempool": xxxxx       (numeric) Maximum memory usage for the mempool
"mempoolminfee": xxxxx    (numeric) Minimum fee rate in KTV/kB for tx to be
                          accepted. Is the maximum of minrelaytxfee and
                          minimum mempool fee
"minrelaytxfee": xxxxx    (numeric) Current minimum relay fee for transactions
```

#### `ischange` added to `getaddressinfo` output

Boolean value, to return whether the KTV (transparent) address was used for change output.

#### `mapped_as` added to `getpeerinfo` output

The `getpeerinfo` RPC now includes a mapped_as field to indicate the mapped Autonomous System used for diversifying peer selection. See the `-asmap` configuration option described above, in section "Configuration/Settings changes".

#### Show wallet's auto-combine settings in `getwalletinfo`

`getwalletinfo` now has two additional auto-combine related return fields. `autocombine_enabled` (boolean) and `autocombine_threshold` (numeric) that will show the auto-combine threshold and whether or not it is currently enabled ([PR #2248](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2248)).

#### Deprecate the autocombine RPC command

The `autocombine` RPC command has been replaced ([PR #2248](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2248)) with specific set/get commands (`setautocombinethreshold` and `getautocombinethreshold`, respectively) to bring this functionality further in-line with our RPC standards. Previously, the `autocombine` command gave no user-facing feedback when the setting was changed. This is now resolved with the introduction of the two new commands as detailed below:

* `setautocombinethreshold`
    ```
    setautocombinethreshold enable ( value )
    This will set the auto-combine threshold value.
    Wallet will automatically monitor for any coins with value below the threshold amount,
    and combine them if they reside with the same KTV address.  When auto-combine runs,
    it will create a transaction, and therefore will be subject to transaction fees.

    Arguments:
    1. enable          (boolean, required) Enable auto combine (true) or disable (false)
    2. threshold       (numeric, optional. required if enable is true) Threshold amount.
                       Must be greater than 1.

    Result:
    {
      "enabled": true|false,     (boolean) true if auto-combine is enabled, otherwise false
      "threshold": n.nnn,        (numeric) auto-combine threshold in KTV
      "saved": true|false        (boolean) true if setting was saved to the database, otherwise false
    }
    ```

* `getautocombinethreshold`
    ```
    getautocombinethreshold
    Returns the current threshold for auto combining UTXOs, if any

    Result:
    {
      "enabled": true|false,    (boolean) true if auto-combine is enabled, otherwise false
      "threshold": n.nnn        (numeric) the auto-combine threshold amount in KTV
    }
    ```

#### New RPC Commands

* `listwallets`
    ```
    Returns a list of currently loaded wallets.
    For full information on the wallet, use "getwalletinfo"
    Result:
    [                       (json array of strings)
      "walletname"            (string) the wallet name
       ...
    ]
    ```

* `rescanblockchain`
    ```
    rescanblockchain (start_height) (stop_height)
    Rescan the local blockchain for wallet related transactions.
    Arguments:
    1. start_height    (numeric, optional) block height where the rescan should start
    2. stop_height     (numeric, optional) the last block height that should be scanned
    Result:
    {
        start_height     (numeric) The block height where the rescan has started. If omitted,
                         rescan  started from the genesis block.
        stop_height      (numeric) The height of the last rescanned block. If omitted, rescan
                         stopped at the chain tip.
    }
    ```

* `getnodeaddresses`
    ```
    getnodeaddresses ( count "network" )

    Return known addresses which can potentially be used to find new nodes in the network

    Arguments:
    1. count        (numeric, optional) The maximum number of addresses to return. Specify 0
                       to return all known addresses.
    2. "network"  (string, optional) Return only addresses of the specified network. Can be
                       one of: "ipv4", "ipv6", "onion".
    Result:
    [
      {
        "time": ttt,          (numeric) Timestamp in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT)
                              when the node was last seen
        "services": n,        (numeric) The services offered by the node
        "address": "host",    (string) The address of the node
        "port": n,            (numeric) The port number of the node
        "network": "xxxx"     (string) The network (ipv4, ipv6, onion) the node connected through
      }
      ,...
    ]
    ```

* `importmulti`
    ```
    importmulti "requests" ( "options" )
    Import addresses/scripts (with private or public keys, redeem script (P2SH)), rescanning all addresses in one-shot-only (rescan can be disabled via options). Requires a new wallet backup.

    Arguments:
    1. requests     (array, required) Data to be imported
    [     (array of json objects)
      {
        "scriptPubKey": "script" | { "address":"address" }, (string / JSON, required) Type of
                                  scriptPubKey (string for script, json for address)
        "timestamp": timestamp | "now"                   (integer / string, required) Creation
                                  time of the key in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT), or the
                                  string "now" to substitute the current synced blockchain time.

Database cache memory increased
--------------------------------

As a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default database cache of 100 MiB has suffered.
For this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.
For nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to 100 MiB (or to another value) by either:
- Adding `dbcache=100` in `ktv.conf`
- Adding `-dbcache=100` startup flag
- Changing it in the GUI under `Settings → Options → Main → Size of database cache`

Note that the database cache setting has the most performance impact during initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime ([PR #2391](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2391)).

Updated settings
----------------

Netmasks that contain 1-bits after 0-bits (the 1-bits are not contiguous on the left side, e.g. 255.0.255.255) are no longer accepted. They are invalid according to RFC 4632.

Build system changes
--------------------

#### C++14 standard

KTV now requires a C++14 compiler ([PR #2269](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2269)).

#### Bump miniUPnPc API version

The minimum supported miniUPnPc API version is set to 10. This keeps compatibility with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Debian 8 `libminiupnpc-dev` packages. Please note, on Debian this package is still vulnerable to [CVE-2017-8798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8798) (in jessie only) and [CVE-2017-1000494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000494) (both in jessie and in stretch).

OpenSSL is no longer used by KTV

#### Disabled PoW mining RPC Commands

A new configure flag has been introduced to allow more granular control over weather or not the PoW mining RPC commands are compiled into the wallet. By default they are not. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--enable-mining-rpc` to the `configure` script ([PR #2105](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2105)).

#### NAT-PMP Support

KTV v5.3.0 added NAT-PMP port-mapping support via [`libnatpmp`](https://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/libnatpmp.html). Similar to how UPnP is treated, NAT-PMP will be compiled if the library is found, but the functionality is disabled unless either using the `-natpmp` option at startup (see section "Configuration changes"), or selecting the relative checkbox in the graphical interface (see section "GUI changes").

Alternatively, KTV can be compiled with the functionality enabled by default passing `--enable-natpmp-default` to the `configure` script.

ISO 8601 for timestamps in logs and backup file names
-----------------------------------------------------

The log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. "2021-02-28T12:34:56Z").
The file extension applied to automatic backups is now in ISO 8601 basic notation (e.g. "20210228T123456Z"). The basic notation is used to prevent illegal `:` characters from appearing in the filename ([PR #2300](https://github.com/kmushi-coin/kmushicoin-source/pull/2300)).
