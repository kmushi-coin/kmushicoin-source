KTV version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/ktv-project/ktv/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/ktv-project/ktv/issues>


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/KTV-Qt (on Mac) or ktvd/ktv-qt (on Linux).

Sapling Parameters
==================

In order to run, KTV now requires two files, `sapling-output.params` and `sapling-spend.params` (with total size ~50 MB), to be saved in a specific location.

For the following packages, no action is required by the user:
- macOS release `dmg` binaries will use the params that are bundled into the .app bundle.
- Windows installer `.exe` will automatically copy the files in the proper location.
- Linux `PPA/Snap` installs will automatically copy the files in the proper location.

For the other packages, the user must save the param files in the proper location, before being able to run KTV v5.0.0:
- macOS/Linux `tar.gz` tarballs include a bash script (`install-params.sh`) to copy the parameters in the appropriate location.
- Windows `.zip` users need to manually copy the files from the `share/ktv` folder to the `%APPDATA%\KTVParams` directory.
- self compilers can run the script from the repository sources (`params/install-params.sh`), or copy the files directly from the `params` subdirectory.

Compatibility
==============

KTV is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

From KTV 6.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no longer supported.

KTV should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

The node's known peers are persisted to disk in a file called `peers.dat`. The
format of this file has been changed in a backwards-incompatible way in order to
accommodate the storage of Tor v3 and other BIP155 addresses. This means that if
the file is modified by v5.3 or newer then older versions will not be able to
read it. Those old versions, in the event of a downgrade, will log an error
message "Incorrect keysize in addrman deserialization" and will continue normal
operation as if the file was missing, creating a new empty one. (#2411)

Notable Changes
==============

Deterministic Masternode Lists
------------------------------

KTV v6.0.0 introduces on-chain consensus for masternode lists, which allow for deterministic quorum derivation, implementing Dash's [DIP-0003](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md).

In the previous masternode system, each node needed to maintain their own individual masternode list with P2P messages, thus discrepancies might occur, for example, due to a different order of message reception.
Deterministic Masternode lists are lists of masternodes, built at every block, relying only on on-chain data (previous list, and transactions included in the current block).
All nodes derive (and verify) their masternode lists independently, from the same on-chain transactions, thus they immediately reach consensus on the tier-two state (number of masternodes, properties and status of each one).

Masternodes are "registered" by special transactions called ProTx, and removed only by spending the collateral.
A ProTx either creates a 10000-KTV collateral as tx output, or includes a reference to an unspent 10000-KTV utxo on chain (and a proof of ownership).
See PR [#2267](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2267) for more information.

    Creates and sends a ProUpServTx to the network. This will update the IP address
    of a masternode, and/or the operator payout address.
    If the IP is changed for a masternode that got PoSe-banned, the ProUpServTx will also revive this masternode.

    Arguments:

    Creates and sends a ProUpServTx to the network. This will update the IP address
    of a masternode, and/or the operator payout address.
    If the IP is changed for a masternode that got PoSe-banned, the ProUpServTx will also revive this masternode.

    "txid"                        (string) The transaction id.
    ```

### GUI changes

!TODO

### Protocol changes

Starting with the enforcement block, masternode rewards and budget payments are paid as outputs of the coinbase transaction, instead of the coinstake transaction.
With this rule, a new opcode (`0xd2`) is introduced (see PR [#2275](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2275)).
It enforces the same rules as the legacy cold-staking opcode, but without allowing a "free" script for the last output of the transaction.
The new opcode takes the name of `OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY`, and the legacy opcode (`0xd1`) is renamed to `OP_CHECKCOLDSTAKEVERIFY_LOF` (last-output-free).
Scripts with the old opcode are still accepted on the network (the restriction on the last-output is enforced after the script validation in this case), but the client creates new delegations with the new opcode, by default, after the upgrade enforcement.

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

- The Tor onion service that is automatically created by setting the
  `-listenonion` configuration parameter will now be created as a Tor v3 service
  instead of Tor v2. The private key that was used for Tor v2 (if any) will be
  left untouched in the `onion_private_key` file in the data directory (see
  `-datadir`) and can be removed if not needed. KTV will no longer
  attempt to read it. The private key for the Tor v3 service will be saved in a
  file named `onion_v3_private_key`. To use the deprecated Tor v2 service (not
  recommended), then `onion_private_key` can be copied over
  `onion_v3_private_key`, e.g.
  `cp -f onion_private_key onion_v3_private_key`. (#19954)

Multi-wallet support
--------------------

KTV now supports loading multiple, separate wallets (See [PR #2337](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2337)). The wallets are completely separated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.

Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one `-wallet` argument when starting KTV client, either on the command line or in the ktv.conf config file.

**In ktv-qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions.** GUI selectable multiple wallets will be supported in a future version. However, even in 6.0 other loaded wallets will remain synchronized to the node's current tip in the background.

KTV 6.0.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and ktv-cli for multi-wallet:

* When running KTV with a single wallet, there are **no** changes to the RPC interface or `ktv-cli`. All RPC calls and `ktv-cli` commands continue to work as before.
* When running KTV with multi-wallet, all *node-level* RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>` endpoint, and `ktv-cli` commands should be run as before. A *node-level* RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.
* When running KTV with multi-wallet, *wallet-level* RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they're intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name>` endpoint, for example `127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat`. `ktv-cli` commands should be run with a `-rpcwallet` option, for example `ktv-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance`.

* A new *node-level* `listwallets` RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the `rpcwallet` argument.

The `getwalletinfo` RPC method returns the name of the wallet used for the query.

Note that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version 6.0.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.

Wallets directory configuration (`-walletdir`)
----------------------------------------------

KTV now has more flexibility in where the wallets directory can be
located. Previously wallet database files were stored at the top level of the
KTV data directory. The behavior is now:

- For new installations (where the data directory doesn't already exist),
  wallets will now be stored in a new `wallets/` subdirectory inside the data
  directory by default.
- For existing nodes (where the data directory already exists), wallets will be
  stored in the data directory root by default. If a `wallets/` subdirectory
  already exists in the data directory root, then wallets will be stored in the
  `wallets/` subdirectory by default.
- The location of the wallets directory can be overridden by specifying a
  `-walletdir=<path>` option where `<path>` can be an absolute path to a
  directory or directory symlink.

Care should be taken when choosing the wallets directory location, as if it
becomes unavailable during operation, funds may be lost.

External wallet files
---------------------

The `-wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets
to be located in the -walletdir directory.

Newly created wallet format
---------------------------

If `-wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now
create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat
data file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just
creating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent
directory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than
before because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without
having to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.

For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files
in the `-walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the
same as before.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- When KTV is not started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of
  the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is
  now the empty string `""` instead of `"wallet.dat"`. If KTV is started
  with any `-wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the
  name of any wallet is just its `<path>` string.
  
### New RPC Commands

* `getnodeaddresses`
    ```
    getnodeaddresses ( count "network" )

    Return known addresses which can potentially be used to find new nodes in the network

    Arguments:
    1. count      (numeric, optional) The maximum number of addresses to return. Specify 0 to return all known addresses.
    2. "network"  (string, optional) Return only addresses of the specified network. Can be one of: ipv4, ipv6, onion.
    Result:
    [
      {
        "time": ttt,          (numeric) Timestamp in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT) when the node was last seen
        "services": n,        (numeric) The services offered by the node
        "address": "host",    (string) The address of the node
        "port": n,            (numeric) The port number of the node
        "network": "xxxx"     (string) The network (ipv4, ipv6, onion) the node connected through
      }
      ,...
    ]
    ```

Database cache memory increased
--------------------------------

As a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default database cache of 100 MiB has suffered.
For this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.
For nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to 100 MiB (or to another value) by either:
- Adding `dbcache=100` in ktv.conf
- Adding `-dbcache=100` startup flag
- Changing it in the GUI under `Settings → Options → Main → Size of database cache`

Note that the database cache setting has the most performance impact during initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime.


Reindexing changes
------------------

It is now possible to only redo validation, without rebuilding the block index, using the command line option `-reindex-chainstate` (in addition to `-reindex` which does both).
This new option is useful when the blocks on disk are assumed to be fine, but the chainstate is still corrupted. It is also useful for benchmarks.


Mining/Staking transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent")
--------------------------------------------------------------

The block-generation transaction selection algorithm now selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed ancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is relayed.
With this change, the `-blockminsize` command line option has been removed.


Removal of Priority Estimation - Coin Age Priority
--------------------------------------------------

In previous versions of KTV, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent. This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners/stakers, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks. 
KTV v6.0.0 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority (See [PR #2378](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2378)). This has the following implications:

- The concept of *free transactions* has been removed. High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn't attach a miner fee. This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority. The `-limitfreerelay` and `-relaypriority` options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.
- The `-blockprioritysize` option has been removed.
- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC no longer takes a `priority_delta` argument. The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the `fee_delta` argument.
- `-minrelaytxfee` can now be set to 0. If `minrelaytxfee` is set, then fees smaller than `minrelaytxfee` (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation. This defaults to 10000 satoshi/kB.
- The `-printpriority` option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.


GUI changes
-----------

- The launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS

### Settings

A new checkbox has been added to the wallet settings UI to enable or disable automatic port mapping with NAT-PMP.
If both UPnP and NAT-PMP are enabled, a successful allocation from UPnP prevails over one from NAT-PMP.

Note: Successful automatic port mapping requires a router that supports either UPnP or NAT-PMP.

### RPC-Console

The GUI RPC-Console now accepts "parenthesized syntax", nested commands, and simple queries (see [PR #2282](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2282).
A new command `help-console` (available only on the GUI console) documents how to use it:

```
This console accepts RPC commands using the standard syntax.
    example:    getblockhash 0

This console can also accept RPC commands using parenthesized syntax.
    example:    getblockhash(0)

Commands may be nested when specified with the parenthesized syntax.
    example:    getblock(getblockhash(0) true)

A space or a comma can be used to delimit arguments for either syntax.
    example:    getblockhash 0
                getblockhash,0

Named results can be queried with a non-quoted key string in brackets.
    example:    getblock(getblockhash(0) true)[tx]

Results without keys can be queried using an integer in brackets.
    example:    getblock(getblockhash(0),true)[tx][0]
```


Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments
------------------------------------

Commands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the `ktv-cli` binary can now use named arguments. This follows the [JSON-RPC specification](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) for passing parameters by-name with an object.
`ktv-cli` has been updated to support this by parsing `name=value` arguments when the `-named` option is given.

Some examples:

```
    src/ktv-cli -named help command="help"
    src/ktv-cli -named getblockhash height=0
    src/ktv-cli -named getblock blockhash=000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
    src/ktv-cli -named sendtoaddress address="DMJRSsuU9zfyrvxVaAEFQqK4MxZg6vgeS6" amount="1.0" comment="donation"
```

The order of arguments doesn't matter in this case. Named arguments are also useful to leave out arguments that should stay at their default value.
The RPC server remains fully backwards compatible with positional arguments.


Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

### Query options for listunspent RPC

- The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument (see [PR #2317](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2317)), which is a JSON object
  containing one or more of the following members:
  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs
  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs

- The `listunspent` RPC also takes an additional boolean argument `include_unsafe` (true by default) to optionally exclude "unsafe" utxos.
  An unconfirmed output from outside keys is considered unsafe (see [PR #2351](https://github.com/KTV-Project/KTV/pull/2351)).

- The `listunspent` output also shows whether the utxo is considered safe to spend or not.

- the `stop` RPC no longer accepts the (already deprecated, ignored, and undocumented) optional boolean argument `detach`.

### Subtract fee from recipient amount for RPC

A new argument `subtract_fee_from` is added to `sendmany`/`shieldsendmany` RPC functions.
It can be used to provide the list of recipent addresses paying the fee.
```
subtract_fee_from         (array, optional) 
A json array with addresses.
The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each selected address.
  [\"address\"          (string) Subtract fee from this address\n"
   ,...
  ]
```

For `fundrawtransaction` a new key (`subtractFeeFromOutputs`) is added to the `options` argument.
It can be used to specify a list of output indexes.
```
subtractFeeFromOutputs    (array, optional)  A json array of integers.
The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
The outputs are specified by their zero-based index, before any change output is added.
  [vout_index,...]
```

For `sendtoaddress`, the new parameter is called `subtract_fee` and it is a simple boolean.

In all cases those recipients will receive less KTV than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
If no outputs/addresses are specified, the sender pays the fee as usual.

### Show wallet's auto-combine settings in getwalletinfo

`getwalletinfo` now has two additional return fields. `autocombine_enabled` (boolean) and `autocombine_threshold` (numeric) that will show the auto-combine threshold and whether or not it is currently enabled.

### Deprecate the autocombine RPC command

The `autocombine` RPC command has been replaced with specific set/get commands (`setautocombinethreshold` and `getautocombinethreshold`, respectively) to bring this functionality further in-line with our RPC standards. Previously, the `autocombine` command gave no user-facing feedback when the setting was changed. This is now resolved with the introduction of the two new commands as detailed below:

* `setautocombinethreshold`
    ```  
    setautocombinethreshold enable ( value )
    This will set the auto-combine threshold value.
    Wallet will automatically monitor for any coins with value below the threshold amount, and combine them if they reside with the same KTV address
    When auto-combine runs it will create a transaction, and therefore will be subject to transaction fees.
    
    Arguments:
    1. enable          (boolean, required) Enable auto combine (true) or disable (false)
    2. threshold       (numeric, optional. required if enable is true) Threshold amount. Must be greater than 1.
    
    Result:
    {
      "enabled": true|false,     (boolean) true if auto-combine is enabled, otherwise false
      "threshold": n.nnn,        (numeric) auto-combine threshold in KTV
      "saved": true|false        (boolean) true if setting was saved to the database, otherwise false
    }
    ```

* `getautocombinethreshold`
    ```
    getautocombinethreshold
    Returns the current threshold for auto combining UTXOs, if any

    Result:
    {
      "enabled": true|false,    (boolean) true if auto-combine is enabled, otherwise false
      "threshold": n.nnn         (numeric) the auto-combine threshold amount in KTV
    }
    ```

Updated settings
----------------

- Netmasks that contain 1-bits after 0-bits (the 1-bits are not contiguous on
  the left side, e.g. 255.0.255.255) are no longer accepted. They are invalid
  according to RFC 4632.

Build system changes
--------------------

The minimum supported miniUPnPc API version is set to 10. This keeps compatibility with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Debian 8 `libminiupnpc-dev` packages. Please note, on Debian this package is still vulnerable to [CVE-2017-8798](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8798) (in jessie only) and [CVE-2017-1000494](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000494) (both in jessie and in stretch).

OpenSSL is no longer used by KTV


P2P and network changes
-----------------------

#### Removal of reject network messages from KTV (BIP61)

The command line option to enable BIP61 (`-enablebip61`) has been removed.

Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send valid ("reject")
messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a trusted node.
Please use the recommended alternatives if you rely on this feature:

* Testing or debugging of implementations of the KTV P2P network protocol
  should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent
  version of KTV. Bitcoin Core logs debug messages
  (`-debug=<category>`) to a stream (`-printtoconsole`) or to a file
  (`-debuglogfile=<debug.log>`).

* Testing the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `submitblock`

* Testing the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `sendrawtransaction`

* Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a
  transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject"
  messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation
  to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Thus, they
  could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee
  target they set (compare the RPC `estimatesmartfee`)) or listen for the
  transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.

#### NAT-PMP Support
- Added NAT-PMP port mapping support via [`libnatpmp`](https://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/libnatpmp.html)


Configuration changes
---------------------

### Configuration sections for testnet and regtest

It is now possible for a single configuration file to set different options for different networks. This is done by using sections or by prefixing the option with the network, such as:

    main.uacomment=ktv
    test.uacomment=ktv-testnet
    regtest.uacomment=regtest
    [main]
    mempoolsize=300
    [test]
    mempoolsize=100
    [regtest]
    mempoolsize=20

The `addnode=`, `connect=`, `port=`, `bind=`, `rpcport=`, `rpcbind=`, and `wallet=` options will only apply to mainnet when specified in the configuration file, unless a network is specified.

### Allow to optional specify the directory for the blocks storage

A new init option flag '-blocksdir' will allow one to keep the blockfiles external from the data directory.

### Disable PoW mining RPC Commands

A new configure flag has been introduced to allow more granular control over weather or not the PoW mining RPC commands are compiled into the wallet. By default they are not. This behavior can be overridden by passing `--enable-mining-rpc` to the `configure` script.

### Enable NAT-PMP port mapping at startup

The `-natpmp` option has been added to use NAT-PMP to map the listening port. If both UPnP
and NAT-PMP are enabled, a successful allocation from UPnP prevails over one from NAT-PMP.

### Removed startup options

- `printstakemodifier`

### Logging

The log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. "2021-02-28T12:34:56Z").

### Automatic Backup File Naming

The file extension applied to automatic backups is now in ISO 8601 basic notation (e.g. "20210228T123456Z"). The basic notation is used to prevent illegal `:` characters from appearing in the filename.
